# Text-file-zipper
text file zipper is a website which is used to encode and decode the text file.

In this project, I use Html, CSS, JavaScript as front end and php as local hosting of the site.

-- basically in this we encode and decode the text file only.
-- it's ideology is based on the Huffman coding which is the technique of compression.
-- for this project I use some dsa concepts like heap, mapping.
